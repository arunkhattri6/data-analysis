## FAQ

#### Why Org-mode and not Jupyter notebook?

Org-mode as a light weight Jupyter Notebook. It's  easy to mix text, LaTeX markup, code, and the results of running that code in a single file. That’s a real win to do reproducible research or simply trying to simplify your workflow. Since everything is text, it’s easy to integrate it into your version control system. You don’t need a browser, and there’s no hidden state.
